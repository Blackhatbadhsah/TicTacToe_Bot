Tic-Tac-Toe Console Game

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe console game! This classic game allows you to play Tic-Tac-Toe against a bot player on the console.

How to Play:

Setup:
The game starts with a 3x3 grid displayed on the console. You (as the human player) will be assigned the symbol 'X', and the bot player will be assigned the symbol 'O'.

Gameplay:
You'll take turns with the bot player to make moves on the grid. To make a move, you'll need to enter the column and row numbers of the cell where you want to place your symbol ('X'). For example, to place your symbol in the top-left corner, you'd enter '0 0' (column 0, row 0).

Winning:
The game continues until one player forms a line of three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or until the entire grid is filled without a winner (a draw).

Ending the Game:
Once the game ends, the result will be displayed on the console, indicating whether you won, lost, or the game ended in a draw.
